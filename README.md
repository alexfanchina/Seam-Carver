# SeamCarving
Content-aware image resizing.

### Introduction
Seam carving is the resizing of images by removing the lowest-energy vertical and horizontal "seams."

This allows for dynamic resizing of existing images to fit a wide variety of screens and panels.

### More Information
An excellent discussion of seam carving can be found at Princeton's [Algorithms and Data Structures, Part II](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/seamCarving.html) website.

A dynamic demonstration of seam carving is also available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcIJXTlugc).

### Motivation
This project was completed for [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2).

If you're in that course or related course right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
