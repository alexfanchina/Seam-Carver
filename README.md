# Seam-Carver

Seam-Carver is a content-aware image resizing application helping to change the image's aspect ratio. It resize images by removing the lowest-energy vertical and horizontal "seams." This technique, [*seam carving*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving), is proposed by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir at [*
Seam carving for content-aware image resizing*](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1276390) in 2007.

A dynamic demonstration of seam carving is also available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcIJXTlugc).

This Java project is implemented as an application of seam carving. More functionalities are under construction. This repository is forked from [mgruben/seam-carving](https://github.com/mgruben/seam-carving).


## Usage

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml) on your computer.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local directory.
3. Enter `javac SeamCarver.java` in your terminal to compile. You should see files `SeamCarver.class` and `Picture.class` in the same directory after comiling.

## Reduce image height or width
```
java SeamCarver <imagefile> <h|w> <numberOfSeamsToRemove>
```
For example, enter `java SeamCarver example.jpg h 200` if you wanted to reduce the width of picture `example.jpg` by 200 pixels.

## Increase image height or width [ üöß Under construction üë∑üîßÔ∏èüöß ]

Better interaction solutions are under construction.
